This is my personal online business card. 
It will show progress on path to conquering React as it's my first attempt in React world.

Started on September 30th, 2017 as an attempt to rewrite site on http://www.ntmedia.me in current technologies.

Few notes and credits:
- Project started with `create-react-app`, which brings its (although minimal) architectural decisions,
which I'm not sure I'm quite fond of. Might take a different path along the way.
- I've used added mixins for easier theme management, written by an unknown author, found in `_color-mixins.scss`.
